# Color me surprised (¬∞.¬∞)

Oh? You're a developer huh?

So, you must like coding right?

Well, why don't you\

Jk jk, I made this theme with Callibrity's colors just to see what's it like.\
It was pretty fun. And this is technically an extension!\
So now who knows what I might develop next in VSCode!! üòé

Out of one rabit hole and into the next, love,

## <u>Developer Notes</u>

To create this, I needed to follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme#create-a-new-color-theme).

Essentially you need these two tools:

`npm i -g yo generator-code` to create the project\
`npm i -g @vscode/vsce` to build the VSIX file

Once you've made changes, you'll need to `vsce package` to build the VSIX file.\
Use `code --install-extension .\callibrity-theme-0.0.1.vsix` to install it within VSCode.

To use this within Visual Studio, see the following video from Microsoft: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gwqr5uuBt4

Yes, those are their instructions.\
There is an open source tool they're pointing you to use to basically side load the theme. Ridiculous.

It's literally formattting and color schemes. How could they have gotten this so badly wrong :eye-roll:

## **Enjoy!**
